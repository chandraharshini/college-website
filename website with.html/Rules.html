    <p><h3><li><ol>To join **Central Saint Martins (CSM)** in London, you must follow a strict set of academic and creative rules governed by the University of the Arts London (UAL).</li></ol>
         <li><ol>The primary rule for admission is the submission of a **comprehensive digital portfolio**, which is weighted more heavily than traditional exam scores;</li></ol>
          <li><ol>it must demonstrate not just finished pieces, but your entire creative process, including sketches and failed experiments.</ol></li>
          <li><ol>>Academically, international students are generally required to provide proof of English proficiency, typically through an **IELTS Academic score** ranging from 6.0 to 7.5 depending on the level of study. </ol></li>
         <li><ol>> Undergraduates must apply through the **UCAS system** by the January deadline, while postgraduate applicants must submit a detailed research proposal or a personal statement that aligns with the specific "pathway" or specialized lens of their chosen course.</ol></li></h3>
<br>
<h3>Once enrolled, the rules transition into **Professional Conduct and Studio Etiquette**.
 Students are required to maintain a high attendance record, particularly international students on Student Visas, as the college is legally mandated to report significant absences to the UK Home Office.
  A critical rule involves **Health and Safety Inductions**; no student is permitted to use the specialized workshops, laser cutters, or heavy machinery at the King’s Cross campus without first passing a safety certification. 
  Furthermore, the college strictly enforces **Academic Integrity**, meaning all work must be original; the unauthorized use of AI or plagiarism of existing designs can lead to immediate disciplinary action or expulsion.
   Finally, access to the campus is restricted by electronic ID cards, and sharing these credentials with non-students is considered a major security violation.</ol></h3></p>



<h4> Key Summary of Rules</h4>

* **Creative Rule:** Portfolio must show "process" (sketchbooks), not just final results.
* **Legal Rule:** 80-100% attendance is often required for visa compliance.
* **Safety Rule:** Mandatory "Technical Induction" before using any studio equipment.
* **Administrative Rule:** All undergraduate applications must go through **UCAS**.

**Would you like me to draft a sample Personal Statement or a Checklist for your CSM portfolio?**</h3></p>
